# The Fourth Way to Embed CSS - fint.css
Traditionally, CSS was implemented using the following methods, even used together: inline, embedded, external.
Fint.css aims to create a fourth, and simplistic way of implementing CSS easily without hassaling with link tags, embedded blocks, or ugly inline styles.

## The Mission
To allow the implementation of CSS through a simplistic and understandable system of inline _class_ *mods* and *operators*.
Additionally, by providing a simplistic system to style _html elements_, **__fint.css__** hopes to provide a more logically clear, structured and inline perspective to understanding the front-end web development process.
