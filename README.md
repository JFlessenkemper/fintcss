# Fint.css - A framework for all your needs! 🏗️
#### This framework is not only modularly atomic ⚛️ 
#### ...but it's a foundation for which you'll build your sanity.


Fint.css is a structually modular framework for CSS, it's easy to use, and even easier to understand and read. Many CSS class names and frameworks lack proper fundamental principles to class naming and website structure.

psst. Use the CodeKit config with CodeKit to compile this locally. 📦
